# Hangman Game
Design and implement a classic hangman game in Python, where players attempt to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game should randomly select a word from a predefined list and display the corresponding number of blanks for each letter in the word. Players will input their guesses, with correct guesses revealing the corresponding letters in the word, while incorrect guesses result in the gradual drawing of a hangman scaffold. The game should continue until the player correctly guesses the word or exhausts their allowed attempts, providing a fun and interactive experience for players.
